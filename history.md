Added backing up of terrain and (region) xml files

## 23-Jan-2025
If script is reset, an immediate backup occurs. If the usual backup time occurs later in the same day, it was skipped and the next update would occur the following day. This update still allows the immediate backup to occur, but schedules the next backup to the usual time later in the day.
